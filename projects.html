                <li>This project involves user input and threads. The purspose of the project was an experiment to see
                    if I make a user and a computer interact with each other in an intelligent way. It did not work and the computer
                    tended to just insult the user. Wich devolved even further into a game wich insults the player every time they make a mistake

                <li>This project was done in Operating Systems, it introduced us to computer graphics and showed us how
                    computers search through directories and display files with both thier sizes and file type.

                <li>This project was done in my Artificical intelligence class. We we had to write code that would generate a random
                    valid Sodoku puzzle. That the computer would then remove a random number of cells to give to another player to solve.
                    This project gave us experience with choco solver.
